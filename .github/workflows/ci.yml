  # NOTE: MUSL cross-compilation is not currently supported because GStreamer
  # system libraries are built with glibc. The glibc headers are incompatible
  # with MUSL's libc, causing compilation failures. True MUSL support would
  # require either MUSL-compatible GStreamer packages or significant package
  # restructuring to support header-only compilation.
